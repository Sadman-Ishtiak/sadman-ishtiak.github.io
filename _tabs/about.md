# Hi there! 👋

My name is **Sadman Ishtiak**. I am currently a student at **Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University (JKKNIU)**, pursuing a degree in **Computer Science and Engineering**.

I am a fast learner and a fast forgetter—a **"torn sachel"**, if I may describe myself. This blog is the digital patch for that sachel; it's where I store the information I've learned (and am still learning) so it doesn't leak away. I'm sharing it here for my own quick reference and for anyone else who might find it useful.

## 🎓 Academic Journey
I am currently in my **4th Year, 1st Semester** at JKKNIU.

### ✅ Completed (3rd Year, 1st Semester)
I've successfully navigated through these "battles":
- **Microprocessors (CSE-301):** Finalized 8086 assembly and architecture.
- **Operating Systems (CSE-303):** Mastered process scheduling and memory management.
- **Theory of Computation (CSE-305):** Conquered the abstract world of automata and languages.
- **Internet & Web Programming (CSE-307):** Built and deployed web applications.
- **Data Communication (CSE-309):** Understood the physical and logical layers of data travel.

## 📜 The "Sachel" Patches (Certifications)
To stop the knowledge from leaking out, I've been collecting some official patches:

### 🛠️ MATLAB Academy
- **Computer Vision Onramp** (Feb 2026) – *Learning to track turtles through digital eyes.*
- **Image Processing Onramp** (Feb 2026) – *Understanding the pixels that make up our world.*
- **Signal Processing Onramp** (Jan 2026) – *Making sense of the waves and frequencies.*
- **MATLAB Onramp** (Jan 2026) – *The foundation of my MATLAB journey.*

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Others
- **Cisco NetAcad: Introduction to Cybersecurity** – *Learning the fundamentals of staying safe in a digital world.*
- **TryHackMe Enthusiast** – *Frequently spotted in various THM rooms, learning the ropes of ethical hacking and CTFs.*

## 🚀 Interests & Goals
I'm particularly interested in **Computer Vision**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Low-level Programming**. Whether it's detecting objects in a video stream or reverse-engineering a binary, I love the challenge of figuring out how things work under the hood.

Feel free to follow along, catch my mistakes, or suggest new things for me to learn!

*I hope you have a beautiful day.*
