# Hi there

My name is Sadman Ishtiak, I am currently a student in Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am a fast learner and a fast forgetter (A torn sachel if I may describe). So this blog is the place where I am storing the informations that I have learned and will be learning in the future which I may not feel particular shame sharing. And also will work as a place for me to make a quick reference. Feel free to follow along if you find this interesting and also feel free to help me learn new things by catching my mistakes and suggesting me new things to learn.

I hope you have a beautiful day.
