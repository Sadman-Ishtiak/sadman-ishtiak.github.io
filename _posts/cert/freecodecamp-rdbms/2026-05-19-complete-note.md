## Code Editors and IDEs
### What is a Code Editor?
A code editor is a software application that allows programmers to write and edit source code. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools to enhance the coding experience.

### What is an IDE?
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a comprehensive software suite that combines a code editor with additional tools for software development. It typically includes features like a code editor, compiler, debugger, and version control integration, all in one application.

In short, a code editor is a tool for writing code or any text type file, while an IDE is a complete environment for software development that includes a code editor along with other essential tools.


## How to Install VScode 
Since I am using linux, I run 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

in the terminal to install VScode.

VScode uses directories as workspaces, so I can open a folder in VScode and it will treat that folder as a workspace. This allows me to organize my projects and files efficiently within VScode.

Additionally, Live Server is a popular extension that is the go to for web development as it can automatically reload the browser whenever changes and also check for errors in the code. It is a great tool for web developers to see their changes in real-time and ensure that their code is error-free.
### Useful Shortcuts in VScode
- `Ctrl+S` — Save
- `Ctrl+C` — Copy
- `Ctrl+V` — Paste
- `Shift+Alt+F` — Format file
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` — Search in files
- `Ctrl+Shift+H` — Replace in files
- `Ctrl+Shift+K` — Delete line
- `Ctrl+B` — Toggle sidebar
- `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` — Zoom in/out
- `Ctrl+Alt+Down` / `Ctrl+Alt+Up` — Add cursor down/up
- `Alt` + click — Add cursor
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` — Command palette

### Recommended Extensions for VScode
- Better Comments — highlights TODOs, questions, and warnings in comments.
- Code Spell Checker — in-code spellchecking that understands camelCase.
- Error Lens — highlights the whole line and shows error messages inline.
- Indent Rainbow — colors indentation levels for easier scope reading.
- AI assistants — GitHub Copilot or Tabnine for inline suggestions.
- Visuals — VS Code Great Icons and Colorize for icons and CSS color previews.
- Language tools — ESLint + Prettier (JavaScript); Pretty TypeScript Errors (TypeScript).
- Fun extras — VS Code Pets (virtual pets), Power Mode (visual effects), Discord Presence.

## Bash Fundamentals
### Understanding the Command Line and Working with Bash
#### What Is the Terminal, and How Does It Differ from the Command Line?
**Command line:** the text-based interface where you type and run commands.
**Terminal:** the application or terminal emulator that provides a command-line window.
**Shell:** the program (e.g., Bash, PowerShell, cmd) that interprets and executes commands.

On Windows you'll commonly use Command Prompt or PowerShell (or the newer Windows Terminal to host multiple shells). macOS provides Terminal (third-party alternatives include iTerm). Linux has many terminals (gnome-terminal, Konsole, kitty, etc.), usually installable via your distro's package manager.

These terms are related and often used interchangeably, but they refer to different layers of the same workflow.

#### What Are Some Shortcuts You Can Use in the Command Line to Speed Up Productivity?
- `Up` / `Down` arrows — cycle command history.
- `Tab` — autocomplete commands and filenames.
- `Ctrl+L` (or `cls` in PowerShell) — clear the screen.
- `Ctrl+C` — interrupt/stop a running command (on Windows it can copy when text is selected).
- `Ctrl+Z` then `fg` — suspend to background and resume (Unix shells).
- `!!` — repeat the last command.

Note: Autocomplete behavior varies by shell (zsh uses history; PowerShell suggests commands/variables).

#### What Is Bash, and What Are Some Basic Commands?
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a common Unix shell. Essentials:
- `pwd` — show current directory.
- `cd` — change directory (`..` = parent; supports absolute and relative paths).
- `ls` — list files (`-a` show hidden, `-l` long listing); use `less`/`cat` to view files.
- `mkdir` / `touch` — create directories and files.
- `mv` — move or rename; `cp` — copy (`-r` for directories).
- `rm` — remove files or directories (`-r` recursive; `-f` force).
- `echo` — print text; use `>` to overwrite and `>>` to append.
- `head` / `tail`, `chown` / `chmod` — other common utilities.
- `man` — read a command's manual page.

#### What Are Some Command Options and Flags?
Options (flags) modify a command's behavior. Short form uses one hyphen and single letters (e.g., `-a`); long form uses two hyphens and words (e.g., `--all`). Examples:

- `--help` — show usage.
- `--version` — show program version.
- Combine short flags: `ls -al` == `ls -a -l`.
- Option values: `--width=50` or `-w 50`.

Use `--help` or `man` to check syntax.

### Bash Commands Review
#### Terminal, Shell, and Command Line Basics (summary)
- `Command line` — text interface where you type commands.
- `Terminal` — application or terminal emulator that hosts the command line.
- `Shell` — program that interprets commands (e.g., Bash, PowerShell, cmd).
- Windows: PowerShell, Command Prompt, Windows Terminal.
- macOS: Terminal (or iTerm, Ghostty).
- Linux: gnome-terminal, Konsole, kitty, etc.

#### Command Line Shortcuts (quick)
- `Up` / `Down` — cycle history.
- `Tab` — autocomplete.
- `Ctrl+L` / `cls` — clear the screen.
- `Ctrl+C` — interrupt a command.
- `Ctrl+Z` then `fg` — suspend and resume (Unix).
- `!!` — rerun the last command.

#### Bash Basics (quick)
- `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`.
- `echo` (`>` overwrite, `>>` append), `head`/`tail`, `chown`/`chmod`.
- `exit`, `clear`, `find -name`, `man`.

#### Command Options and Flags (quick)
- Short: `-a`; Long: `--all`.
- Chain short flags: `ls -alh`.
- Values: `-w 50` or `--width=50`.
- Use `--help` to check syntax.
