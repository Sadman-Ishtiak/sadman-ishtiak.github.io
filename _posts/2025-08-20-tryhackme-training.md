## Task 3: Write a Cyber Security Training Investment Proposal
This section describes how to calculate the return on investment of the cost of training. As training needs to be done by the organization there has to be a return on the investment. We calculate the return by making a small but realistic improvement assumption on a certain training and then calculate how much improvement we get from the training cost. Generally if the cost is lower than the return it is always better to train the employees of the organization.
