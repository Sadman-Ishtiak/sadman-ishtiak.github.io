# Coding assembly in emu8086
If you already know C assembly is basically a longer way of doing things. The procedures are the same but here we use `jump` for branching and in C we specifically try not to use similar functionality with `goto`. There are some more changes in assembly as well but the general gist of work is the same.
## Starting template
Assembly will require us to use a standard and some skeleton or a standard template, 
```asm
.MODEL SMALL
.STACK 100H 

.DATA
    ; variable definition and initialization section

.CODE
MAIN PROC
    ; Code section
MAIN ENDP
END  MAIN
```

we can see the four section model, stack, data and code. For most of our cases we do not need to use any other than `.model small` and `100h` or `256bytes` of stack memory. and the rest of the things are basically template code. we can also include exiting from DOS in this if we want to as well but generally the program will still function without it. Here is the code to that, 
```asm
; Exiting DOS
    MOV AX, 4CH
    INT 21h
```

## Defining variables
## Taking a character input
## Outputting a single character
## Outputting string
Here is the code to print "Hello world!!".
```asm
.MODEL SMALL
.STACK 200H 

.DATA 
MSG DB  'Hello World!!', '$' ; Defines a string with ending character

.CODE
MAIN PROC
; Initialize the data variables @ data
    MOV AX, @DATA
    MOV DS, AX

; Pringing the MSG
    MOV AH, 09h
    LEA DX, MSG
    INT 21h

; Exiting the program
    MOV AX, 4CH
    INT 21h
MAIN ENDP
END  MAIN
```
The output of the program is
![alt text](/assets/images/asm-hello-world.png)

Program procedure - 
1. The program first defines a string variable named MSG with bytes filling them with `'Hello World!!', '$'` which means the memory indicated by MSG will contain `Hello World!!$` where `$` here is used as the string breaker. In C we use null character `\0` and here we are using `$`. 
2. Then we initialize the variables defined in the data segment first in the code segment
3. Then we write the proram to print a string varialble
    1. we set `ah` to `09h`
    2. we load effective address of the string to `dx`
    3. call int 21h 

This effectively calls the DOS interrupter to print whatever is in the memory untill it finds a `$` in the DOS terminal.
4. Then optional closing the DOS terminal
5. Then we end the proram

## Inputting a string
