# Coding assembly in emu8086
If you already know C assembly is basically a longer way of doing things. The procedures are the same but here we use `jump` for branching and in C we specifically try not to use similar functionality with `goto`. There are some more changes in assembly as well but the general gist of work is the same.
## Starting template
Assembly will require us to use a standard and some skeleton or a standard template, 
```asm
.MODEL SMALL
.STACK 100H 

.DATA
    ; variable definition and initialization section

.CODE
MAIN PROC
    ; Code section
MAIN ENDP
END  MAIN
```

we can see the four section model, stack, data and code. For most of our cases we do not need to use any other than `.model small` and `100h` or `256bytes` of stack memory. and the rest of the things are basically template code. we can also include exiting from DOS in this if we want to as well but generally the program will still function without it. Here is the code to that, 
```asm
; Exiting DOS
    MOV AX, 4CH
    INT 21h
```

## Defining variables
## Taking a character input
## Outputting a single character
## Outputting string
## Inputting a string
