# Posting in the blog
when posting in the chirpy blogging you need to remember the following-

1. First the naming of the files must be in the YYYY-MM-DD-something.md format
2. Then the file structure each file have the following in format defined by the official chirpy guide
```yaml

```
3. Image connecting is done using the standard template `![image description](image url)`
    1. URL linking is done quite easy as the URL is the only things that need to work using `![public domain image](https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/collections/moseley-coffee/rowlandson-mad-dog.jpg)`
![public domain image](https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/collections/moseley-coffee/rowlandson-mad-dog.jpg)
    2. file connecting is slightly different as we need to put the file in assets directory and link to that using `![static linking](/assets/images/rowlandson-mad-dog.png)`
![static linking](/assets/images/rowlandson-mad-dog.png)
4. The same way we put the file in the image we can also make downloadable links as well using the standard markdown URL linking `[dowloadable file](/assets/pdf/3-1-theory-exam.pdf)`
[dowloadable file](/assets/pdf/3-1-theory-exam.pdf)
5. We can statically link youtube url in as well using `{``% include embed/youtube.html id='dQw4w9WgXcQ' %}` in a separate line. Rickroll for example.
{% include embed/youtube.html id='dQw4w9WgXcQ' %}
6. equation rendering can be done inline $e = mc^2$ using `$e = mc^2$` or separate line using `$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$`

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

There are more things but these are the only few things that I need to use in almost every posts so I may not going to add anything in this page unless I need to use this.
