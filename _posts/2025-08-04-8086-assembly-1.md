# Pretalk
If you're studying in Bangladesh or India, there's a good chance that your assembly language practical course uses **8086 Assembly** with the **EMU8086** software. This approach is quite common in academic settings. However, it's also true that assembly language isn't widely used in most modern development workflows, so many instructors may have limited hands-on experience with it beyond their own education. As a result, some of the teaching may focus more on theory than practical, real-world applications.

But you have to pass this course with and you cannot bullshit your way through considering the examiner's theoratical knowledge will kick off the  bullshit sensor in their brain when you try to do so. So we will focus on only the necessary things we need to know to make sure we don't fail and we don't trip their bullshit sensor as well.

## Knowledge needed
If you are using **EMU8086** in the exam you can get pass by using the built in snippets but most teachers will just cut some portions of the program and make you rewrite that on the spot, in that case you need to know some theory and coding tricks before you even try to attempt something

1. Registers and memory of the 8086 microprocessor
2. Sections of assembly code
2. Which instructions with which memory can work and which combinations of source and destinations are legal
3. The AH value that does special functions that you may need to use
4. The process of coding it in any low level language like C
5. Commenting the code frequently to make the code more readable and use the C program as your coding reference

## 8086 Registers
![8086 memory shown in emu8086 software](/assets/images/emu8086.png)

8086 microprocessor is a 16bit microprocessor and there are three kinds of registers in 8086 microprocessors. they are
1. General Purpose Registers
<table width='100%'>
  <tr>
    <th>16-bit</th>
    <th>High byte (8-bit)</th>
    <th>Low byte (8-bit)</th>
    <th>Common Use</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AX</td>
    <td>AH</td>
    <td>AL</td>
    <td>Accumulator (for arithmetic)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BX</td>
    <td>BL</td>
    <td>BH</td>
    <td>Base (used in addressing)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CX</td>
    <td>CH</td>
    <td>CL</td>
    <td>Counter (used in loops, shifts)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DX</td>
    <td>DH</td>
    <td>DL</td>
    <td>Data (used in I/O, multiplication)</td>
  </tr>

2. Index Pointer Registers
<table width='100%'>
  <tr>
    <th>Register</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SP</td>
    <td>Stack Pointer (points to top of the stack)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BP</td>
    <td>Base Pointer (used to access parameters in stack frames)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SI</td>
    <td>Source Index (used in string/memory operations)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DI</td>
    <td>Destination Index (used in string/memory operations)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

3. Segment Registers

| Register | Purpose                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| CS       | Code Segment (where instructions are fetched from) |
| DS       | Data Segment (default for variables)               |
| SS       | Stack Segment (used with the stack)                |
| ES       | Extra Segment (used for string operations)         |

4. Flag Registers

| Flag | Description                         |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| CF   | Carry Flag                          |
| ZF   | Zero Flag                           |
| SF   | Sign Flag                           |
| OF   | Overflow Flag                       |
| PF   | Parity Flag                         |
| AF   | Auxiliary Carry (used in BCD)       |
| DF   | Direction Flag (used in string ops) |
| IF   | Interrupt Enable Flag               |
